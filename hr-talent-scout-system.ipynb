    "# 🏆 Capstone Project: The HR Talent Scout Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Project Overview\n",
    "The **HR Talent Scout** is a Multi-Agent System designed to streamline the recruitment process while maintaining strict safety and compliance standards. It solves the problem of manual candidate screening by orchestrating a collaboration between an internal **Recruitment Coordinator** and an external **Background Check Vendor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how AI agents can handle sensitive business workflows—automating the tedious data gathering (background checks) while strictly enforcing **Human-in-the-Loop** oversight for high-stakes decisions (job offers).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Architecture & Design\n",
    "This system utilizes a **Service-Oriented Architecture** simulated locally within this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The \"Vendor Agent\" (External Service):**\n",
    "    * **Role:** Simulates a third-party background check provider.\n",
    "    * **Tech:** Exposed as an independent service on `localhost:8001` using the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**.\n",
    "    * **Privacy:** Operates in isolation; the main agent cannot see its internal database, only the API response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The \"Recruitment Coordinator\" (Internal Orchestrator):**\n",
    "    * **Role:** The main user-facing agent.\n",
    "    * **Tech:** Powered by **Gemini 1.5 Flash Lite** using the Google ADK.\n",
    "    * **Workflow:** Screens candidates $\\rightarrow$ Queries Vendor (A2A) $\\rightarrow$ Drafts Offer $\\rightarrow$ Pauses for Approval (LRO).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Key Technical Features\n",
    "This project demonstrates mastery of the 5-Day AI Agents curriculum by implementing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **🔗 Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication:** The Recruiter agent uses `RemoteA2aAgent` to autonomously negotiate with the Vendor agent to verify candidate records (\"Clear\" vs \"Flagged\").\n",
    "* **✋ Long-Running Operations (LRO):** Implements a **compliance pause**. The agent uses `request_confirmation` to halt execution and wait for explicit human approval before sending any offer letter.\n",
    "* **🤖 Advanced Tooling:** Custom Python tools (`generate_offer`, `send_official_offer`) are defined and bound to the agent's specialized persona.\n",
    "* **🛡️ Robust Error Handling:** The system is architected to handle session context and prevent tool hallucinations through strict prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
